varioius backend to do stuff.

make Istream retirevals, this for backup and archive purposes.  with just a bit of Istream retrieval we can
	grab  any portion of the Istream, and any orgl(s) in a way that we can re-enter them, even in the
	face of catastrophic software failure.

redo the acount stuff, so that the fe is notified of the account name, but isn't in control.

redo the bert stuff so that all docs and versions are created in the  users 
account.  so that opening someone elses doc gives a version.  Later shift 
to a capibilities system.

  get  socket number

expand select data so that  nplayers can be >25 


note the recient changes to bedaemon have broken ints/intx glue for the frontend
