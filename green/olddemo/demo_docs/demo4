Dear Mr. Funk,

Thank you very much for your fascinating inquiry.  We would be very
interested in negotiating some sort of arrangement to produce and
market your wonderful invention.  We believe it would make oodles of
money for all of us.  Our lawyers will be contacting you shortly to
work out the details of the license agreement.  I'm sure mutually
satisfactory terms can be arranged.  In the mean time, please feel
free to call me at the number given above.       

                                        Sincerely,
                                        MEL
