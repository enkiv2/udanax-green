NAME
     conti - Chip's oozing continent pretty-picture program

SYNOPSIS
     conti [ itcnt [ dispcnt [ seed ]]]

DESCRIPTION
     Conti is an oozing continent pretty-picture program for the Ann Arbor
     Terminals "Ambassador" (60 line display)

     "itcnt" is an iteration count.  It tells how many passes of the algorithm
     to perform between displays (default 1).

     "dispcnt" is a display count.  It tells how many times to display a
     screenful of stuff (default 1).

     "seed" is a random number seed (default is taken from the low bits of
     the current time).

     This program generates pretty oozing continental patterns according to
     the following algorithm:  starting with a screenful of random black and
     white blocks, pick coordinates at random and span them outward in a
     Von Neuman window (up, down, left and right but not diagonally).  Repeat
     many times.

FILES
     It really wants to send its output to a terminal and not to a file.

BUGS
     It doesn't know when it has reached a stable state.
