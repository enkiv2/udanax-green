Welcome to Udanax Green!

    QUICK START: just type "make demo".  Read on for details...


The software consists of two main parts: the back-end and the front-end.
(Nowadays people commonly refer to these as the server and client.)

The back-end is written in C.  The source code is in the green/ directory.
To build the executable, go into the green/ directory and run "make".  It
should compile painlessly on any Linux system.  For some other systems,
you may need to edit be_source/Makefile to choose the appropriate options
to the C compiler.

The front-end is written in Python.  It is located in the pyxi/ directory.
It should run on any system that has Python 1.4 or better with Tcl/Tk
support.  When you start Pyxi, it will also run the back-end in the be/
subdirectory.  The set of documents you view and edit is stored in a single
file called an enfilade file, located at be/enf.enf.  If you want to save a
snapshot of the enfilade or replace it with another, just copy or replace
this file.  If be/enf.enf is not present, Pyxi will start up by copying in
the sample dataset, which contains some instructions and the Declaration of
Independence.

The back-end has a few known bugs, which have surfaced during testing with
the Pyxi front-end.  However, it should be stable enough for you to try it
out and get a feel for what the powerful data structures and algorithms in
the server can do.  All of the back-end code was part of the Xanadu hypertext
project, and is now released to the public as open source.
