Welcome to Pyxi, the Python Udanax Interface.

This is a front-end user interface for the Udanax Green server
program, which manages hypertext documents that may be linked
together in arbitrary ways, that can share text, and that can
be branched off into new revisions.  The interface is both a
browser and an editor (simply turn on editing mode in the Edit
menu to begin editing the text directly).

You need a few prerequisites before you can play with Pyxi:

    - You must have Python 1.4 or better, with Tcl/Tk support.
      Most Linux distributions include Python 1.5 nowadays.
      If you have installed a recent distribution your system
      should have everything you need.

    - You must have a working back-end.  To compile the
      back-end server, go into the green/ directory, which is
      a sibling of this one, and run "make".

    - Pyxi expects the back-end program to be called "backend",
      and will run it in a subdirectory called "be".  The "be"
      directory must exist and "be/backend" can be a copy of
      the server executable or a symbolic link.  If the Udanax
      distribution unpacked correctly, this link should already
      be there.

That's it!  To start Pyxi, simply do (in this directory):

    ./pyxi

The first document which appears will contain more instructions
about how to use Pyxi and what interesting things it can do using
the power of the Udanax hypertext document model.

This version of Pyxi was released on 2 September 1999.

to follow the ongoing development of the project, to read about
how the data structures and algorithms work, and to download
software updates and source code as they become available.

Note that an understanding of the mechanisms in the back-end
server wasn't necessary in order to write the user interface.
Pyxi was written based entirely on a specification for the
client-server protocol, which is available online at
